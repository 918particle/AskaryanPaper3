  abstract = {The in-ice radio interferometric phased array technique for detection of high energy neutrinos looks for Askaryan emission from neutrinos interacting in large volumes of glacial ice, and is being developed as a way to achieve a low energy threshold and a large effective volume at high energies. The technique is based on coherently summing the impulsive Askaryan signal from multiple antennas, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio for weak signals. We report here on measurements and a simulation of thermal noise correlations between nearby antennas, beamforming of impulsive signals, and a measurement of the expected improvement in trigger efficiency through the phased array technique. We also discuss the noise environment observed with an analog phased array at Summit Station, Greenland, a possible site for an interferometric phased array for radio detection of high energy neutrinos.},

  abstract = {{CORSIKA} 8 is a new framework for simulations of particle cascades in air and dense media implemented in modern C++17, based on past experience with existing codes, in particular {CORSIKA} 7. The flexible and modular structure of the project allows the development of independent modules that can produce a fully customizable particle shower simulation. The radio module in particular is designed to treat the electric field calculation and its propagation through complex media to each observer location in an autonomous and flexible way. It already allows for the simultaneous simulation of the radio emission calculated with two independent time-domain formalisms, the “Endpoint formalism” as previously implemented in {CoREAS} and the “{ZHS}” algorithm as ported from {ZHAireS}. The design acts as the baseline interface for current and future development for the simulation of radio emission from particle showers in standard and complex scenarios, such as cross-media showers penetrating from air into ice. In this work, we present the design and implementation of the radio module in {CORSIKA} 8, along with validation studies and a direct comparison of the radio emission from air showers simulated with {CORSIKA} 8, {CORSIKA} 7, and {ZHAireS}. We also present the impact of simulation details such as the step size of simulated particle tracks on radio-emission simulations and perform a direct comparison of the “Endpoints” and “{ZHS}” formalisms for the same underlying air showers. Finally, we present an in-depth comparison of {CORSIKA} 8 and {CORSIKA} 7 for optimum simulation settings and discuss the relevance of observed differences in light of reconstruction efforts for the energy and mass of cosmic rays.},

Detection of radio-frequency radiation, at macroscopic wavelengths, has blossomed within the last decade as a competitive method for the measurement of cosmic particles, particularly charged cosmic rays and neutrinos. Cosmic-ray detection via radio emission from extensive air showers has been demonstrated to be a reliable technique that has reached a reconstruction quality of the cosmic-ray parameters competitive with more traditional approaches. Radio detection of neutrinos in dense media seems to be the most promising technique to achieve the gigantic detection volumes required to measure neutrinos at energies beyond the {PeV}-scale flux established by {IceCube}.

  abstract = {Radio antennas have become a standard tool for the detection of cosmic-ray air showers in the energy range above 10 16 {eV}. The radio signal of these air showers is generated mostly due to the deflection of electrons and positrons in the geomagnetic field, and contains information about the energy and the depth of the maximum of the air showers. Unlike the traditional air-Cherenkov and air-fluorescence techniques for the electromagnetic shower component, radio detection is not restricted to clear nights, and recent experiments have demonstrated that the measurement accuracy can compete with these traditional techniques. Numerous particle detector arrays for air showers have thus been or will be complemented by radio antennas. In particular when combined with muon detectors, the complementary information provided by the radio antennas can enhance the total accuracy for the arrival direction, energy and mass of the primary cosmic rays. Digitization and computational techniques have been crucial for this recent progress, and radio detection will play an important role in next-generation experiments for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. Moreover, stand-alone radio experiments are under development and will search for ultrahigh-energy photons and neutrinos in addition to cosmic rays. This article provides a brief introduction to the physics of the radio emission of air showers, an overview of air-shower observatories using radio antennas, and highlights some of their recent results.},

In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array instrument of the Askaryan Radio Array, a previous analysis has incidentally identified 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency signals originating from below the ice surface. We here present a detailed reanalysis of these events. The observed event rate, radiation arrival directions, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with in-ice Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source. An origin from the geomagnetic separation of charges in cosmic ray air showers is disfavored by the arrival directions and polarization. Considering the arrival angles, timing properties, and the impulsive nature of the passing events, the event rate is inconsistent with the estimation of the combined background from thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of \$5.1{\textbackslash} ,σ\$.}

We further verified the agreement in the observed cosmic-ray signal shape with expectations from simulations after careful treatment of the detector systematics. Finally, we find that the reconstructed arrival direction, energy, and polarization of the cosmic-ray candidates agrees with expectations. Throughout this study, we identified detector shortcomings that are mitigated going forward.

This has led to improved trigger-level sensitivity to {UHE} neutrinos. Working with data collected by the Askaryan Radio Array ({ARA}), we search for neutrino candidates at the lowest threshold achieved to date, leading to improved analysis-level sensitivities. A neutrino search on a data set with 208.7 days of livetime from the reduced-threshold fifth {ARA} station is performed, achieving a 68\% analysis efficiency over all energies on a simulated mixed-composition neutrino flux with an expected background of 0.10-0.04+0.06 events passing the analysis. We observe one event passing our analysis and proceed to set a neutrino flux limit using a Feldman-Cousins construction. We show that the improved trigger-level sensitivity can be carried through an analysis, motivating the phased array triggering technique for use in future radio-detection experiments. We also include a projection using all available data from this detector. Finally, we find that future analyses will benefit from studies of events near the surface to fully understand the background expected for a large-scale detector.},

In the firn, the index of refraction changes due to the transition from snow at the surface to glacial ice below, affecting the propagation of radio signals in that region. We compare our observations to a finite-difference time-domain ({FDTD}) electromagnetic wave simulation, which supports the existence of three classes of propagation: a bulk propagation ray-bending mode that leads to so-called “shadowed” regions for certain geometries of transmission, a surface-wave mode induced by the ice/air interface, and an arbitrary-depth horizontal propagation mode that requires perturbations from a smooth density gradient. In the non-shadowed region, our measurements are consistent with the bulk propagation ray-bending mode both in timing and in amplitude. We also observe signals in the shadowed region, in conflict with a bulk-propagation-only ray-bending model, but consistent with {FDTD} simulations using a variety of firn models for Summit Station. The amplitude and timing of our measurements in all geometries are consistent with the predictions from {FDTD} simulations. In the shadowed region, the amplitude of the observed signals is consistent with a best-fit coupling fraction value of 2.4\% (0.06\% in power) or less to a surface or horizontal propagation mode from the bulk propagation mode. The relative amplitude of observable signals in the two regions is important for experiments that aim to detect radio emission from astrophysical high-energy neutrinos interacting in glacial ice, which rely on a radio propagation model to inform simulations and perform event reconstruction.},

An antenna placed1𝒪(15 m) below the ice surface will measure two signals for the vast majority of events (90\% at Eν=1018 {eV}): a direct pulse and a second delayed pulse from a reflection off the ice surface. This allows for a unique identification of neutrinos against backgrounds arriving from above. Furthermore, the time delay between the direct and reflected signal (D'n'R) correlates with the distance to the neutrino interaction vertex, a crucial quantity to determine the neutrino energy. In a simulation study, we derive the relation between time delay and distance and study the corresponding experimental uncertainties in estimating neutrino energies. We find that the resulting contribution to the energy resolution is well below the natural limit set by the unknown inelasticity in the initial neutrino interaction. We present an in-situ measurement that proves the experimental feasibility of this technique. Continuous monitoring of the local snow accumulation in the vicinity of the transmit and receive antennas using this technique provide a precision of 𝒪(1 mm) in surface elevation, which is much better than that needed to apply the D'n'R technique to neutrinos.},

We detect a muon with an estimated energy of 12 0 - 60 + 110 petaelectronvolts ({PeV}). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5-7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.},

Because of deflection by interstellar magnetic fields, cosmic rays produced within the Milky Way arrive at Earth from random directions.

We searched for neutrino emission using machine learning techniques applied to 10 years of data from the {IceCube} Neutrino Observatory. By comparing diffuse emission models to a background-only hypothesis, we identified neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5σ level of significance. The signal is consistent with diffuse emission of neutrinos from the Milky Way but could also arise from a population of unresolved point sources.},

Whereas this energy scale is out of reach for currently operating and future planned particle accelerators, natural astrophysical phenomena are expected to produce antineutrinos with energies beyond the {PeV} scale. Here we report the detection by the {IceCube} neutrino observatory of a cascade of high-energy particles (a particle shower) consistent with being created at the Glashow resonance. A shower with an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 {PeV} (determined from Cherenkov radiation in the Antarctic Ice Sheet) was measured. Features consistent with the production of secondary muons in the particle shower indicate the hadronic decay of a resonant W− boson, confirm that the source is astrophysical and provide improved directional localization. The evidence of the Glashow resonance suggests the presence of electron antineutrinos in the astrophysical flux, while also providing further validation of the standard model of particle physics. Its unique signature indicates a method of distinguishing neutrinos from antineutrinos, thus providing a way to identify astronomical accelerators that produce neutrinos via hadronuclear or photohadronic interactions, with or without strong magnetic fields. As such, knowledge of both the flavour (that is, electron, muon or tau neutrinos) and charge (neutrino or antineutrino) will facilitate the advancement of neutrino astronomy. A particle shower detected by the {IceCube} Neutrino Observatory at the very high energy of the Glashow resonance demonstrates its potential for the study of high-energy particle physics and astrophysics.},

However, at PeV (10\$\textasciicircum\{15\}\$ eV) energies and above, most of the universe is impenetrable to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the most extreme environments of the universe where black holes, neutron stars, and stellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays. The discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on the universe. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes and environments that govern the universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2 is designed to: 1) Resolve the high-energy neutrino sky from TeV to EeV energies; 2) Investigate cosmic particle acceleration through multi-messenger observations; 3) Reveal the sources and propagation of the highest energy particles in the universe; 4) Probe fundamental physics with high-energy neutrinos. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the annual rate of observed cosmic neutrinos by a factor of ten compared to IceCube, and will be able to detect sources five times fainter than its predecessor. Furthermore, through the addition of a radio array, IceCube-Gen2 will extend the energy range by several orders of magnitude compared to IceCube. Construction will take 8 years and cost about \textbackslash\$350M. The goal is to have IceCube-Gen2 fully operational by 2033. IceCube-Gen2 will play an essential role in shaping the new era of multi-messenger astronomy, fundamentally advancing our knowledge of the high-energy universe. This challenging mission can be fully addressed only in concert with the new survey instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum and gravitational wave detectors which will be available in the coming years.}},

The analysis employs a set of three cuts that reject background triggers while preserving 90\% of simulated cosmogenic neutrino triggers.

While this measurement has clear radioglaciological applications, the radio clarity of the ice also has implications for the detection of ultra-high energy (UHE) astrophysical particles via their radio emission in dielectric media such as ice. Assuming a reliable extrapolation to higher frequencies, the measured attenuation length at Summit Station is comparable to previously measured radio-frequency attenuation lengths at candidate particle detector sites around the world, and strengthens the case for Summit Station as a promising northern site for UHE neutrino detection.}},

The neutrino production rate can be constrained through the accompanying electrons, positrons and gamma-rays that quickly cascade on the CMB and intergalactic magnetic fields to lower energies and generate a γ-ray background in the GeV–TeV region. Bethe–Heitler pair production by protons also contributes to the cascade and can tighten the neutrino constraints in models where extragalactic cosmic rays begin to dominate over the galactic component at a relatively low “crossover” energy. We investigate this issue in the light of the recent Fermi-LAT measurements of the diffuse extragalactic γ-ray background and illustrate by a fit to the HiRes spectrum how the prediction of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in all-proton models varies with the crossover energy. The neutrino flux is required to be smaller when the gamma-ray bound is applied, nevertheless such models are still consistent with HiRes and Fermi-LAT if one properly takes into account the energy uncertainty of cosmic ray measurements. The presently allowed flux is within reach of the IceCube neutrino telescope and other dedicated radio experiments.}},

These calculations, and the associated open-source code, allow the user to avoid computationally intensive Monte Carlo cascade simulations.

However, confidently reconstructing the radio signals can pose a challenge, as they are often obscured by background noise. Information Field Theory offers a robust approach to this challenge by using Bayesian inference to calculate the most likely radio signal, given the recorded data.

Ultra-high energy (UHE; E >  10 PeV) neutrinos probe the most distant, most explosive sources in the Universe, often obscured to optical telescopes. Radio-frequency (RF) detection of Askaryan radiation in cold polar ice is currently regarded as the best experimental measurement technique for UHE neutrinos, provided the RF properties of the ice target can be well-understood. To that end, the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment at the South Pole has used long-baseline RF propagation to extract information on the index-of-refraction (n=ϵr) in South Polar ice. Owing to the increasing ice density over the upper 150–200 m, rays are measured along two, nearly parallel paths, one of which refracts through an inflection point, with differences in both arrival time and arrival angle that can be used to constrain the neutrino properties. We also observe (first) indications for RF ice birefringence for signals propagating along predominantly horizontal trajectories, corresponding to an asymmetry of order 0.1% between the ordinary and extra-ordinary birefringent axes, numerically compatible with previous measurements of birefringent asymmetries for vertically-propagating radio-frequency signals at South Pole. Qualitatively, these effects offer the possibility of redundantly measuring the range from receiver to a neutrino interaction in Antarctic ice, if receiver antennas are deployed at shallow (z ∼  −25 m) depths. Such range information is essential in determining both the neutrino energy, as well as the incident neutrino direction.}

UHE neutrinos may provide important clues to understanding the nature of cosmic-ray sources. ARIANNA aims to detect UHE neutrinos via radio (Askaryan) emission from particle showers when a neutrino interacts with ice, which is an efficient method for neutrinos with energies between 10\textasciicircum16 eV and 10\textasciicircum20 eV. The ARIANNA radio detectors are located in Antarctic ice just beneath the surface. Neutrino observation requires that radio pulses propagate to the antennas at the surface with minimum distortion by the ice and firn medium. Using the residual hole from the South Pole Ice Core Project, radio pulses were emitted from a transmitter located up to 1.7 km below the snow surface. By measuring these signals with an ARIANNA surface station, the angular and polarization reconstruction abilities are quantified, which are required to measure the direction of the neutrino. After deconvolving the raw signals for the detector response and attenuation from propagation through the ice, the signal pulses show no significant distortion and agree with a reference measurement of the emitter made in an anechoic chamber. Furthermore, the signal pulses reveal no significant birefringence for our tested geometry of mostly vertical ice propagation. The origin of the transmitted radio pulse was measured with an angular resolution of 0.37 degrees indicating that the neutrino direction can be determined with good precision if the polarization of the radio-pulse can be well determined. In the present study we obtained a resolution of the polarization vector of 2.7 degrees. Neither measurement show a significant offset relative to expectation.}},
